Part 1:


Starting with the forward kinematics equations: 𝑥𝑅̇ = r/2 * (angular velocity of r + angular velocity of l)
	And 𝜃 ̇ = r/d * (angular velocity of r - angular velocity of l)
We can simplify these equations to (r * angular velocity of l) / 2 + (r * angular velocity of r)/2
Then we can solve for angular velocity to get:
	angular velocity of l = 1/r * (𝑥𝑅̇  - (d * 𝜃 ̇ )/2) and angular velocity of r = 1/r * (𝑥𝑅̇  - (d * 𝜃 ̇ )/2)
